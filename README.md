# kubernetes-action

Generate a Kubeconfig or creating or updating K8s Deployments. This action is a wrapper around the [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) command line tool to make it easier to use in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions).

This thing is built using [Golang](https://go.dev) and [deploy-k8s](https://github.com/appleboy/deploy-k8s). ðŸš€
